# How to contribute

As the Ongaeshi project is a DAO project, we have opened the Gitbook documentation for developers and the community to edit. 

(Make sure that the files included in the changes are **MD file format**). 

Your changes after merging will be reflected in the public Gitbook.
1. To contribute to this repository, please fork the main branch of this repository. 
https://github.com/Institution-for-a-Global-Society/ongaeshi-document
2. After forking the repository as your own, add the changes you would like to see on the main Gitbook. 
3. When the changes are committed, create a pull request to merge to the main branch of the Ongaeshi Document. **Please set Allow edits by maintainers on your PR**
4. An IGS admin will take a look at the changes and approve or deny the changes.
